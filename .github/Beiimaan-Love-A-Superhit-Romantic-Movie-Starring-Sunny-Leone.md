Beiimaan Love is a film that explores the themes of love, betrayal, revenge and redemption. It showcases Sunny Leone's versatility as an actress and her sizzling chemistry with Rajneesh Duggal and Daniel Weber. The film also has some catchy songs composed by Ankit Tiwari, Kanika Kapoor, Raghav Sachar and Sanjeev Darshan.
 
If you are looking for a superhit romantic movie to watch with your loved ones, you can check out Beiimaan Love on YouTube[^1^] or SoundCloud[^2^]. You can also buy or rent the film on Blu-ray or DVD from various online platforms.
  
However, Beiimaan Love is not a film that will please everyone. The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics who have slammed it for its poor script, direction, acting and logic. The film has been called a "cringe fest", a "glorified videotape" and a "C grade" movie by various reviewers[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. The film has also been criticized for its regressive portrayal of women and its clichÃ©d plot twists.
 
The film did not fare well at the box office either. It was released alongside other films like Mirzya, Tutak Tutak Tutiya and Saat Uchakkey and faced stiff competition from them. The film failed to attract the audiences and was declared a flop by trade analysts. The film reportedly collected only Rs 1.5 crore in its opening weekend and could not recover its budget of Rs 30 crore.
 
Beiimaan Love is a film that had the potential to be a gripping romantic thriller but ended up being a disappointing mess. The film wasted the talent of Sunny Leone who could have done much better with a stronger script and direction. The film also failed to deliver on its promise of being a bold and unconventional love story. Beiimaan Love is a film that can be easily skipped unless you are a die-hard fan of Sunny Leone or cheesy melodrama.
